<span>You feel the world settle around you, or rather you settle into the world.</span>
<!--<br>In front of you, once again, you find the old woman standing with a peculiar glint in her eyes.<br>-->
<!--“Heed my words young hero for your world is filled with terrors unseen.”<br>-->
<!--Her face turns and you follow her gaze.</span>-->
<!--<p>The place where you are standing is in fact Main street, but without the people, and the colors also seem a little off.-->
<!--Everything is brighter and extremely colourful.-->
<!--The woman is looking at a cosmetics store across the street. You don’t know why, but just by looking at it, you feel unnerved.-->
<!--“Evil lurks in bright places.” the woman says. “You have been tainted, as have we all.”-->
<!--“We have been smeared, doused, padded, and splattered.”-->
<!--“And it is all inside of you now. The toxins. The chemicals they clack into their formulas.”-->
<!--“Formulas that promise to do you good. To make you better, or make you pretty, and clean you right up!”</p>-->
<!--<p>She turns, looking you straight in the eye. “It is time you truly clean yourself.”-->
<!--“However, it takes real courage, determination, and brilliance to defeat the destructive Cosmetic Industry.”-->
<!--“You are in the World of Cosmo now. And I, Sheeba, have brought you here to see.”-->
<!--“Now show me what you can do!” &#45;&#45;</p>-->
<!--<p>In the blink of an eye Sheeba disappears. You now find a shiny new bag standing in her place.-->
