        <span>You wander past flickering make up displays.</span>  </div>
        <br>The women on the advertisements gaze seductively at you but instead of looking stunning their appearance frightens you.
        <br>Moving closer to one of the posters you notice there is something wrong with the womanâ€™s mouth and eyes.
        <br>From the corner of your eye you see something pass you by, but when you turn to look the aisle behind you is empty.
        <br>The air circulating in the store smells too sweet for you making you cough involuntarily.
        <br>The sound echoes through the store, and for a time you stand there, waiting quiet and tensed, but nothing happens.
        <br>You walk on and reach the end of the aisle.
