The women on the advertisements gaze seductively at you but instead of looking stunning their appearance frightens you.
Moving closer to one of the posters you notice there is something wrong with the womanâ€™s mouth and eyes.
From the corner of your eye you see something pass you by, but when you turn to look the aisle behind you is empty. </span>

The sound echoes through the store, and for a time you stand there, waiting quiet and tensed, but nothing happens.
You walk on and reach the end of the aisle.</span></div>
