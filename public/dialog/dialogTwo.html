            <p>You feel the world settle around you, or rather you settle into the world.</p>
            <p>In front of you, once again, you find the old woman standing with a peculiar glint in her eyes.
                <br>“Heed my words young hero for your world is filled with terrors unseen.”
                <br>Her face turns and you follow her gaze.

            <p>The place where you are standing is in fact Main street, but without the people, and the colors also seem a little off.
                <br>Everything is brighter and extremely colourful.
                <br>The woman is looking at a cosmetics store across the street. You don’t know why, but just by looking at it, you feel unnerved.
                <br>“Evil lurks in bright places.” the woman says. “You have been tainted, as have we all.”
                <br>“We have been smeared, doused, padded, and splattered.”
                <br>“And it is all inside of you now. The toxins. The chemicals they clack into their formulas.”
                <br>“Formulas that promise to do you good. To make you better, or make you pretty, and clean you right up!”
            </p>

        <div class="part3">
            <p>She turns, looking you straight in the eye. “It is time you truly clean yourself.”
                <br>“However, it takes real courage, determination, and brilliance to defeat the destructive Cosmetic Industry.”
                <br>“You are in the World of Cosmo now. And I, Sheeba, have brought you here to see.”
                <br>“Now show me what you can do!” --
