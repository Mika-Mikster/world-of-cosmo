            <span>As she swings the lipstick in your direction you instinctively evade her first attack.</span>
<!--<br>While you twist the cap off of a bottle of water, the crazed woman sprays a cloud of intoxicating perfume around you.</span>-->
<!--<br>Coughing violently you throw the water in her face.-->
<!--<p>With a deafening howl the saleswoman shrinks away from you.-->
<!--<br>You faintly hear the sound of something falling. *clink clink*-->
<!--<br>“My, my foundation! It’s melting!” Her hands clasping her face, worsening the effect of the water on her caked layers of make up.-->
<!--<br>Panda-eyed and defeated she throws you the ugliest look you have ever seen.-->
<!--<br>In a series of sudden motions she claws her way out the store, leaving you still coughing and catching your breath.</p>-->
<!--<p>On the floor, half hidden under a shelf, lies a key.-->
<!--<br>You pick it up and make your way to the cash counter.-->
<!--<br>Somewhere there must be a lock to match it.-->
<!--<br>In a cabinet underneath the counter you find a hidden safe.-->
<!--</p>-->
