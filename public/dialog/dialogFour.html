                <br>“To truly clean yourself.” Her words echo in your mind.
                <br>You wonder how she intends you accomplish such a thing.
                <br>Absentmindedly your hand glides past a bottle of water.
                <br>Right then you are startled by a loud shriek from above.</span><span>
                <br>An overly made up saleswoman is eyeing you down from behind the shelves.
                <br>The sight of her raises the hairs on your back.
                <br>Her platinum hair looks fried, her skin overly tanned and shriveled, her eyelids are smeared in neon-pink eyeshadow, and the white of her eyes run red with irritated bloodvessels.
                <br>She lets out another shriek.
                <br>The next moment she is down on the floor and comes right at you with a bottle of perfume and uncapped lipstick.
