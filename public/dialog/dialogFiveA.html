            <p>As she swings the lipstick in your direction you instinctively evade her first attack.</p>
            <p>While you twist the cap off of a bottle of water, the crazed woman sprays a cloud of intoxicating perfume around you.
                <br>Coughing violently you throw the water in her face.

            <p>With a deafening howl the saleswoman shrinks away from you.

                <br>Panda-eyed and defeated she throws you the ugliest look you have ever seen.
                <br>In a series of sudden motions she claws her way out the store, leaving you still coughing and catching your breath.

            <p>On the floor, half hidden under a shelf, lies a key.
                <br>You pick it up and make your way to the cash counter.
                <br>Somewhere there must be a lock to match it.
                <br>In a cabinet underneath the counter you find a hidden safe.
