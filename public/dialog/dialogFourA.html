        <span id="dialog1">Shuffling past the rows of painfully vivid-colored shampoo and conditioner you think of what Sheeba told you.
        “To truly clean yourself.” Her words echo in your mind.
        You wonder how she intends you accomplish such a thing.
        Absentmindedly your hand glides past a bottle of water.
        Right then you are startled by a loud shriek from above.</span>
        <br><span id="dialog2">An overly made up saleswoman is eyeing you down from behind the shelves.
        The sight of her raises the hairs on your back.
        Her platinum hair looks fried, her skin overly tanned and shriveled, her eyelids are smeared in neon-pink eyeshadow, and the white of her eyes run red with irritated bloodvessels.
        She lets out another shriek.
        The next moment she is down on the floor and comes right at you with a bottle of perfume and uncapped lipstick.</span>
